When John was a Junior in college he began to feel anxious about his professional future. He had no previous experience or relevant projects to put on his resume. He didn't know where to start and as a first-generation college student, he did not have many people to ask advice from. 
One day his friend suggested that he joined a new app named "InCollege" where he would be able to find other college students and professionals who could offer him advice and guidance. At first, John was skeptical but he joined the InCollege community where he found more people who were in similar situations as him, as well as professionals who had been there before and still found successful careers.
John also met a recruiter in InCollege who ultimately got him a job lined up before graduation. John has now been working for five years as a software developer for Google. There are hundreds of students who have benefited from joining InCollege and you could be the next one!
